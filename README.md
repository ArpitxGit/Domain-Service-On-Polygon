# Domain-Service-On-Polygon

### My own domain service,
You can buy your own domain from my Smart Contract and own it.

### Why Polygon?
Obviously you don't want to pay 42$ as transaction fees, that's average transaction cost on Ethereum.  
So Polygon!  
Polygon is a protocol and framework that consists of a bunch of different blockchains. I'm building my domain service on their most popular chain- **The Polygon PoS Chain** A chain that runs **alongside** the Ethereum and periodically submits **checkpoints** to it.  
Polygon is able to handle a higher transaction count and then it bundles up all those transactions and deposits them to Ethereum as the final source of truth. Since the Polygon PoS chain is EVM compatible, everything that runs on Ethereum can also run on Polygon without any changes.  

### What is ENS?
It stands for Ethereum Name Service. They created the ```.eth``` domain.  
So I'm making a smaller version of ENS on the polygon blockchain: letting you buy a domain NFT and point it to anything you want.  
It's awesome cause, smart contract makes any data universal as it is stored on blockchain.  

### Using Hardhat,
It let us quickly compile smart contracts and test them locally.
